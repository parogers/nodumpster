# NoDumpster

Firefox extension that replaces youtube live chat with an image of a dumpster fire.

This extension happend late one night while watching a Youtube news livestream. 
I was disgusted by the live chat and didn't feel like simply hiding chat was good enough. 

This was written mostly as a joke, as a way to learn something about the WebExtensions API, and also as therapy.
